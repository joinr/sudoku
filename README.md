# sudoku

A slightly different take on Dr. Norvig's Sudoku puzzle solver -

I just use an object array as the board and generate the sets of potentially
affected indexes for any given move.  This gets me decent performance but I
was unable to beat the python implementation by enough to really care.

## Usage

lein uberjar && java -jar target/sudoku.jar
