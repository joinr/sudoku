# sudoku

A slightly different take on Dr. Norvig's 
[Sudoku puzzle solver](https://norvig.com/sudoku.html)


## Algorithm Outline

Starting from Norvig's algorithm, I essentially do the same thing.  I mutably update
a board on each choice keeping track of the possible moves to other locations and
which parts of the board have a chosen number.


I represent the board as an y,x 2d indexed object array of one of three things:
* `nil` - broken constraint
* `number` - chosen value
* `set` - potential values


I used an [optimized set implementation](src/sudoku/longset.clj) where each set
consists of a single long value and I check for which bits are high in order to
decide inclusion to the set.  This works assuming you only want numbers 0-63 in your
set which is plenty for sudoku.



I also create an index tensor to pre-calculate the sets of affected indexes.


I precalculate all of the potential indexes that can be effected by any given move.


When choosing values, I iterate over the affected list of indexes which must include
the desired index to chose and mutably update an object array keeping track of if
the result is valid and which entries need a second pass for constraint propagation.

Constraint propagation is then a reduction over the constraint propagation list, updating
the board mutably or returning nil if a constraint is broken.


The intention was play with this problem from a more numeric perspective.  My hope
is this code isn't too terse or hard to read.
