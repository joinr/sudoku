# sudoku

A slightly different take on Dr. Norvig's 
[Sudoku puzzle solver](https://norvig.com/sudoku.html)


## Algorithm Outline

Starting from Norvig's algorithm, I essentially do the same thing.  I mutably update
a board on each choice keeping track of the possible moves to other locations and
which parts of the board have a chosen number.


I represent the board as an y,x 2d indexed object array of one of three things:
* `nil` - broken constraint
* `set` - potential values


I used an [optimized set implementation](src/sudoku/longset.clj) where each set
consists of a single long value and I check for which bits are high in order to
decide inclusion to the set.  This works assuming you only want numbers 0-63 in your
set which is plenty for sudoku.


I also create an index tensor to pre-calculate the sets of affected indexes.


I precalculate all of the potential indexes that can be effected by any given move
similarly to the original impl.

The intention was play with this problem from clojure potentially attempting a more
numeric conversion.  Hopefully this code isn't to terse or hard.
